    # Few-Shot Examples
    examples:
      - instruction: "Write a SQL query to find the top 10 customers by total purchase amount"
        response: |
          Here's a SQL query to find the top 10 customers by total purchase amount:

          ```sql
          SELECT
              c.customer_id,
              c.customer_name,
              SUM(o.order_total) AS total_purchases,
              COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
          FROM customers c
          JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
          WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
          GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
          ORDER BY total_purchases DESC
          LIMIT 10;
          ```

          **Explanation:**
          - Joins customers with their orders
          - Filters to last 12 months (adjust as needed)
          - Aggregates total purchase amount and order count
          - Orders by total purchases descending
          - Limits to top 10 results

          **Considerations:**
          - Add indexes on `customer_id` and `order_date` for performance
          - Consider whether to include cancelled orders

      - instruction: "Create a Python function that detects outliers in a pandas DataFrame column"
        response: |
          Here's a Python function to detect outliers using the IQR method:

          ```python
          import pandas as pd
          import numpy as np
          from typing import Tuple

          def detect_outliers_iqr(
              df: pd.DataFrame,
              column: str,
              multiplier: float = 1.5
          ) -> Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]:
              """
              Detect outliers in a DataFrame column using the IQR method.

              Args:
                  df: Input DataFrame
                  column: Column name to analyze
                  multiplier: IQR multiplier (default 1.5 for standard outliers)

              Returns:
                  Tuple of (outliers DataFrame, clean DataFrame)
              """
              Q1 = df[column].quantile(0.25)
              Q3 = df[column].quantile(0.75)
              IQR = Q3 - Q1

              lower_bound = Q1 - multiplier * IQR
              upper_bound = Q3 + multiplier * IQR

              outlier_mask = (df[column] < lower_bound) | (df[column] > upper_bound)

              outliers = df[outlier_mask].copy()
              clean_data = df[~outlier_mask].copy()

              print(f"Found {len(outliers)} outliers ({len(outliers)/len(df)*100:.1f}%)")
              print(f"Bounds: [{lower_bound:.2f}, {upper_bound:.2f}]")

              return outliers, clean_data
          ```

          **Usage:**
          ```python
          outliers, clean_df = detect_outliers_iqr(sales_df, 'amount')
          ```

          **Note:** Use `multiplier=3.0` for extreme outliers only.

      - instruction: "How do I improve the performance of a slow SQL query?"
        response: |
          Here are the key strategies to improve SQL query performance:

          ## 1. Analyze the Query Plan
          ```sql
          EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...
          ```
          Look for table scans, nested loops, and high-cost operations.

          ## 2. Add Appropriate Indexes
          - Index columns used in WHERE clauses
          - Index JOIN columns
          - Consider composite indexes for multi-column filters

          ```sql
          CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date_customer
          ON orders(order_date, customer_id);
          ```

          ## 3. Optimize the Query
          - Avoid `SELECT *` - select only needed columns
          - Use `EXISTS` instead of `IN` for subqueries
          - Limit results early with WHERE clauses
          - Avoid functions on indexed columns in WHERE

          ## 4. Consider Data Volume
          - Partition large tables by date
          - Archive historical data
          - Use summary tables for reports

          ## 5. Database-Level Tuning
          - Increase memory allocation
          - Update statistics regularly
          - Consider query caching

          **Quick wins:** Start with indexes on filter and join columns, then analyze the query plan.

          # Break-Even Analysis

          ## Input Variables

          | Parameter | Value | Notes |
          |-----------|-------|-------|
          | Selling Price per Unit | $50.00 | Average revenue per unit |
          | Variable Cost per Unit | $30.00 | Direct materials, labor, etc. |
          | Fixed Costs (Monthly) | $20,000 | Rent, salaries, utilities |
          | Contribution Margin | $20.00 | Price - Variable Cost |
          | CM Ratio | 40% | CM / Price |

          ## Break-Even Calculations

          **Units Break-Even:**
          ```
          Break-Even Units = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin
                          = $20,000 / $20.00
                          = 1,000 units
          ```

          **Revenue Break-Even:**
          ```
          Break-Even Revenue = Fixed Costs / CM Ratio
                            = $20,000 / 40%
                            = $50,000
          ```

          ## Profit Analysis

          | Units Sold | Revenue | Variable Costs | Fixed Costs | Profit |
          |------------|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|
          | 500 | $25,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | ($10,000) |
          | 1,000 | $50,000 | $30,000 | $20,000 | $0 |
          | 1,500 | $75,000 | $45,000 | $20,000 | $10,000 |
          | 2,000 | $100,000 | $60,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 |

          ## Sensitivity Analysis

          | If Fixed Costs Change | New Break-Even |
          |----------------------|----------------|
          | +10% ($22,000) | 1,100 units |
          | -10% ($18,000) | 900 units |

          **Key Insight:** Each $2,000 change in fixed costs moves break-even by 100 units.

          ## Code Review Summary

          **Severity:** Medium
          **Issues Found:** 4

          ### Issues

          1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** (Critical)
          ```python
          # Current (UNSAFE)
          query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

          # Fixed (SAFE)
          query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
          cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
          ```

          2. **Missing Input Validation** (High)
          - `user_id` is not validated before use
          - Could be None, negative, or non-integer
          - Add: `if not isinstance(user_id, int) or user_id < 0: raise ValueError`

          3. **No Error Handling** (Medium)
          - Database connection failures not caught
          - Wrap in try/except with proper logging

          4. **Resource Leak** (Medium)
          - Cursor not closed in finally block
          - Use context manager: `with connection.cursor() as cursor:`

          ### Recommended Fix

          ```python

          ## Setup

          1. **Environment variables:**
             ```bash
             export DB_USER=backup_user
             export DB_HOST=localhost
             export PGPASSFILE=~/.pgpass  # For password
             ```

          2. **Cron job (daily at 2 AM):**
             ```bash
             0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_script.py
             ```

          ## Safety Features
          - Checksum verification
          - Automatic rotation with configurable retention
          - Failure alerts via email
          - Comprehensive audit logging
